        <h2>library facilities</h2>
        <p>
            A library is a collection of materials, books or media that are easily accessible for use and not just for display purposes. It is responsible for housing updated information in order to meet the user's needs on a daily basis. A library provides physical (hard copies documents) or digital access (soft copies) materials, and may be a physical location or a virtual space, or both. A library's collection can include printed materials and other physical resources in many formats such as DVD, CD and Cassette as well as access to information, music or other content held on bibliographic databases.

A library, which may vary widely in size, may be organized for use and maintained by a public body such as a government; an institution such as a school or museum; a corporation; or a private individual. In addition to providing materials, libraries also provide the services of librarians who are trained and experts at finding, selecting, circulating and organizing information and at interpreting information needs, navigating and analyzing very large amounts of information with a variety of resources.

        <h2>sports</h2>
        <p>
            Some people imagine the roar of a crowd at a packed football stadium when they think of college sports, but that's only part of the story. College sports come in a wide variety, including bowling, golf, wrestling, tennis, swimming and even Frisbee. And colleges offer the opportunity for every student to take part in sports — not just the elite student-athletes you see on TV.

Key College Sports Facts
Here are the main things you need to know about college sports:

Through various sports associations, many colleges offer students the chance to play competitive sports at the varsity level.
Some varsity athletes are eligible for sports scholarships through their colleges.
Varsity athletes must meet academic requirements to win and keep sports scholarships.
Every student has an opportunity to play sports — thanks to clubs and intramural leagues.
All college athletes need strong time-management skills to balance classes and homework with practices and games.
Varsity Sports
What does “varsity” mean? Generally, college varsity sports teams:

Represent their college.
Play against teams from other colleges.
Receive at least some funding from their college’s athletic department.
Sports Associations 
Several associations oversee varsity-level competition in various sports for men and women at different colleges. These include the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA) and the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), among others.

The NCAA is the largest and most well known of the college sports associations. When you watch college sports on TV, you’re usually watching NCAA athletes. The NCAA oversees three levels of play:

Division I is the biggest and most competitive NCAA division. Colleges that compete in Division I must offer scholarships — many of them full — to their student-athletes.

Division II athletic programs are smaller and less competitive than those in Division I. Most student-athletes don’t get full-ride scholarships, but many do get some financial aid for playing.

Division III programs are the least competitive. Division III colleges do not offer sports-related financial aid. Still, these schools recruit athletes, and being one can help you get into a college that wants you in its program.
